# Configs

You need two modules that set up the display and buttons for the example MicroPython programs: tft_config.py and tft_buttons.py. These modules configure the display and manage button interactions, ensuring compatibility with various processors and displays. The provided modules are specific to the devices I used during testing; use them as a reference to create configuration modules for your device if it's not one of those included.
